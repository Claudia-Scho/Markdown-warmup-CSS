# GRATIZ.NL

## The Website

We have chosen https://www.gratiz.nl/.

This is a dutch website with promotions and info on free items. 


## Updates

The most recent update was **Friday 22-2-2019 at 10AM**. 

This is mentioned on the website underneath the menu bar. 


## The search

I have found the website by googling **'slechte websites'**

We opened [Victor Weblog](https://www.victorweblog.nl/20-slechtste-websites/).

This website shows a top 20 of bad websites. 

**Gratiz.nl** was number 18 on the list. 


## Why does this website need an update

The website looks outdated. Poor choice of color combinations. The title image is unclear and badly placed. There is too much text on every page which makes it hard to read. The add takes up a lot of space on the top of the page, which draws too much attention. 


## Social Media

**GratiZ.nl** has a Facebook page. This is mentioned on their homepage, with a link.

## Top priorities

1. **Color**

   *Tone down the colors to make it more pleasing for the eye.*

   *The entire color palette has to change in order to make it more modern.*

2. **Text Layout** 

   *More white space between the different offers.* 

   *Styling the fonts for a better overview.*

3. **Homepage**

   *Create a new homepage, because the current homepage contains a list of the 'category' of free items.* 

   *A short and clean explanation of the website combined with a short list of the most popular promo's would make a better homepage.*
