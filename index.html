    <h2> Why does this website need an update </h2>

        <p>The website looks outdated. Poor choice of color combinations. 
            <br>The title image is unclear and badly placed. There is too much text on every page which makes it hard to read. 
            <br>The add takes up a lot of space on the top of the page, which draws too much attention. </p>

    <h2>Social Media</h2> 

        <p><b>Gratiz.nl</b> has a Facebook page. This is mentioned on their homepage, with a link.
            <br><a href="https://www.facebook.com/GratiZ.nl">Visit the Facebook page</a></p>

    <h2> Top priorities </h2>

    <p> <ul>
        <li><b>Color</b></li>
        <p>Tone down the colors to make it more pleasing for the eye.<br> The entire color palette has to change in order to make it more modern.</p>

        <li><b>Text Layout</b></li>
        <p>More white space between the different offers. <br> Styling the fonts for a better overview.</p>

        <li><b>Homepage</b></li>
        <p>Create a new homepage, because the current homepage contains a list of the 'category' of free items. <br> A short and clean explanation of the website combined with a short list of the most popular promo's would make a better homepage. </p> </ul>
